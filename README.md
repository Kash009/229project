# 229project
A machine learning approach to adaptive sampling for monte carlo rendering.

main edits to pbrt exist within src/samplers/adaptive.cpp and adaptive.h:

src/core has additional files svm.h and svm.cpp 
(NOTE: Makefile version still doesn't link properly, use Visual Studio project instead,)

Visualizer code in visualizer/, 

Scenes in scenes/, 

Training data in data/,

Training scripts and Data parsing/labelling scripts in scripts/ .

Also note that this code is rather disorganized right now, but will hopefully get cleaned up and updated over time!
